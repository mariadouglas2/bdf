 · Nairobi. Female Serval. 4/1/93 – 7/6/ Rescued 7/7/ Nairobi was the mascot in a pet store window until she came to live at Big Cat Rescue July 7, The pet store owner was afraid that she would bite the small children who were always taunting her and she was right. Feline Friends London was founded in July with the aim of offering sanctuary to cats at risk of unnecessary euthanasia & to help cats in need in Hackney. Since then FFL has grown into a network of experienced cat rescuers & veterinary & other : admin@ Nairobi Feline Sanctuary also offers cats for adoption. We rescue quite a number of pregnant mothers, and we offer the kittens up for adoption once they are fully vaccinated. We have two newborn kittens’ nurseries. The kittens and the mothers are domiciled in these comfortable and quiet spaces away from the general population.
