Hakchi BRUTAL DOOM is now officially on  and the Hakchi ModStore! Hi, so yeah. The release date is 22nd of September not October. (I got my months mixed around when making the teaser trailer! ha) Our port of Hakchi BRUTAL DOOM is now official released! Have fun ripping and tearing! and you can read about it and grab it from. 2. level 2. ShiftSandShot. Op · 3y · edited 3y. It's much more manageable than the relatively massive size of the Hakchi Doom OST version.. Although the best solution might be to ask Swingflip to make 'd probably be able to work to better integrate the original files. If you own the full retail version of DOOM. Copy the wad file from your retail version over to the DOOM_1_files folder within Hakchi DOOM. You can either add this file in to the zip before dragging over to hakchi or you can ftp it directly to the console if you are running NAND. USB users can just go to the folder like above and add it in directly.
